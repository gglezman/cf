  <h1>Overview</h1>
  
  <h2>Overview of the Cash Flow Application</h2>
  
This application is intended predict future cash flows based on
the current value of cash accounts, funds, loans, CDs and bonds.
  The cash flow results are viewable in either text or graphical format.
<p>
Cash flows are presented from the current date forward for a provisionable
number of months (see <a HREF="#TRACKING_MONTHS">Settings/Tracking Months</a>),
to the end date.
Past cash flows are not tracked, only forward cash flows.
  <p>
    Note: If the opening date of a cash account is prior to the current date,
cash flow will be presented, in text mode, from the account opening date through
the end date. However, graph mode is restricted to begin at the current date.
  <p>Note: Past bond, loan and CD information is held for historical purposes and can be viewed from the Edit Menu
  <p>
    <a NAME="USING_APP"/a>
    <h1>Using The Cash Flow Application</h1>
    <h2>Create a Data File</h2>
The first step in using this application is to create a data file to store
you data. A data file is created using the <a HREF="#NEW_DATABASE">File/New Database File</a>
 menu slection.
Subsequently, you will open this data file using the
<i>File/Open Database File</i>
selection each time you want to use the application.
    <h2>Create an Account</h2>
Next you need to create at least one account. Accounts are created using the
<i>Edit/Accounts</i> menu. You can add a checking account, savings, brokerage, etc.
When you create an account, a corresponding cash account is created. The cash
account holds the cash, the Account you created holds information about the account.
  <p>When you create an account you can specify an Update Method. This method is
used to process .csv files downloaded from the institution that holds the account to update your datafile.
  <p>When creating an account, if the Update Method is other than "Manual", you
will be asked if you want to specify a file to initialize the Account.
If the Update Method is Fidelity Export, you will provide a .csv file
containing portfolio positions on the start date. The account will be initialized based the content of this file. THIS SECTIONB NEEDS TO BE GENERALIZED, NOT SIMPLY ABOUT FIDELITY.
<h2>Subsequent Use</h2>
From there you can add bonds, loans, funds, etc to your account.

<h2>Date Range</h2>
In graph mode, a graph of cash flows is presented for the date range
defined by the 'Date Range' button. The default values for the Date Range
are: the current date through the period defined by the Tracking Months.
For example, if the current date is Jan 1, 2018 and Tracking Months is provisioned for 24 months, the start date is Jan 1, 2018 and the end date is
Jan 1, 2020.
<p>
The graphs presentation can get very 'busy', especially if the Tracking Months
are provisioned to a large number of months. The amount of data shown on the
graph can be reduced via the Date Range button.
 <p>
 The start date can neither precede the current date nor be equal to or follow the end date.
 The end date must be after the start date and can not exceed the end period defined by the Tracking Months.
